# Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts

This repository is for work related to the freeCodeCamp video on Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts with Python
that can be found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ).

I will expand this README as I complete work on the tutorial.
