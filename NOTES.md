## Section 0 - Blockchain

1. Bitcoin - one of the first protocols to use blockchain.
    1. Uses cryptography for decentralized finance.
    2. Not Turing complete - goal use is as asset not smart contract.
2. Ethereum - applied blockchain for decentralized protocols such as agreements and smart contracts.
   1. No central authority or third-party intermediary needed to validate these smart contracts.
   2. Smart contracts are written in code and automatically executed by the blockchain.
3. Oracle problem - Smart contracts need some way to interact with real world data.
   1. Oracles are a device that brings data into a blockchain or does a computation.
   2. How do you decentralize off-chain data?
      1. Chainlink - decentralized network that allows you to bring data into smart contract or do computations.
         1. Note - Patrick Collins works for Chainlink.
4. Features and advantages of blockchain/smart contracts:
   1. Decentralized - there is no centralized source that controls the blockchain. Nodes connect the blockchain together to keep it running.
      1. Example - Robinhood cut off trading on Gamestop and other "meme" stocks as a central authority.  This wouldn't happen with decentralized protocols.
   2. Transparency & flexibility - all moves on the blockchain can be seen by everyone.  Everyone plays by the same rules.
      1. Blockchain is psuedo-anonymous - you can create different accounts and interact with it in many different ways.
   3. Speed & efficiency - bank ACH takes 3-5 days.  Blockchain settlement is substantially faster (down to a couple of seconds).  
   4. Security & immutability - blockchain cannot be changed or tampered with.  Allows for more security on data and transactions.  Everything is stored on the blockchain.
      1. Hacking the blockchain is "nearly" impossible.
   5. Removal of counterparty risk - smart contracts theoretically would prevent bad faith by the opposing party.
      1. Huge industry built around contractual loopholes including denying valid claims and disastrously expensive court cases to enforce clear contractual terms.
      2. Contract parties with more power will use that power to their benefit at the expense of good-faith dealing.
   6. Trustless/trust minimized agreements - don't need to trust the other party with smart contracts as these contracts are based on math.  
      1. 1 + 1 will always equal 2.
5. Next section is on setting up an Ethereum wallet and making a transaction.  I have already done this so I skipped this section.
